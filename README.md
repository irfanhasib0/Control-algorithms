# Control-algorithms
My repository for control theory algorithms implementation.
1. MPC Implementation Done.
2. iLQR implementation Done.

Sample result for iLQR.
** The Video/gif bellow is made faster than real time. In my PC it takes about 20 minutes to complete the loop, as iLQR/MPC algorithm is computattionally expensive.
